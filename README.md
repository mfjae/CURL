# Project idea
The project name is Curl which stands for curated learning. The idea behind this is to create a service in the form of an application to curate free learning on different topics in a step by step fashion. 
# Project background/Business Opportunity
Not everyone is as fortunate financially to be able to support their education goals but it doesn’t mean they can’t learn in a systematic like school curriculum’s for free. Thank God for the internet with a vast wealth of information out there for free. However this can alway pose a challenge on what to look for or where to start. And many may have missed out the opportunity of learning or picking up a new skill cause of the overwhelming nature of the knowledge surrounding the topic.

This service will aim to curate free information across the internet on a growing number of different subject matter and will point students to those free materials in an organized and systematic fashion, helping students to accomplish each goal one step at a time.

This could be potentially used in schools to help guide free learning or casual hobbies who want to pick up a new skill.
